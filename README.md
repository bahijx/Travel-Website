# Travel-Website
The goal of this project is to create a network application using Node JS and JavaScript in a client/server architecture. The web application functions as a basic travel website, allowing users to search for different travel destinations. Users can create an account, add locations to their "want-to-go list," and search for travel destinations. The website is initially hosted on the machine's "local host," and once completed, it is hosted online on the render.com cloud platform.
